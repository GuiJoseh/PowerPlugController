It's a personal project developed by myself for the porposose of turn on/off external devices in my house following the current time.  
To turn On/Off the devices, you need to use relays on pins P1.2, P1.3 and P1.4. Each pin has it own turn on and turn off time what can be setted by the user.  
To compile this project, you need install SDCC and run the .bat file.  
The .hex will be create and you can write this on the microntroller AT89C51 or test it in some simulation program like Proteus.  
This project was developed on Proteus, so you can find the Proteus file with the project.  
The components useds were:  
- 2x Microcontroller AT89C51  
- 1x sensor RTC DS1307  
- 3x Commons buttons  
- 3x 10K resistors  
- 1x buzzer  
- 1x 1K resistor  
- 1x PN2222 transistor  
- 1x 16x2 LCD panel
